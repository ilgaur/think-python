# Question 2: If you have 37 items and want to put them in groups of 5, 
# how many complete groups do you get and how many items are left over?

# Question 3: How could you use modulus to create a "wrap-around" effect in a game?
print("\n--- Question 3: Wrap-around Effect ---")


# Your code here

# The wrong way
wrong_position = current_position + steps_to_move
print(f"Wrong new position (without wrap-around): {wrong_position}")

# The right way using modulus
correct_position = (current_position + steps_to_move) % board_size

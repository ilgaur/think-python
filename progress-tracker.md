# Think Python Progress Tracker

## Current Status
- **Current Chapter**: Chapter 5 - Conditionals and Recursion
- **Current Section**: Section 5.2 - Boolean Expressions (Logical Operators - COMPLETED)
- **Last Completed**: Logical operators (and, or, not) with practical examples
- **Next Target**: Section 5.2 Logical Challenge exercises, then Section 5.3 - Conditional Execution (if statements)

## Short notes from the last session on what we did and where we are:
Completed Section 5.2 on Boolean expressions and logical operators. User successfully explored comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) and logical operators (and, or, not) with hands-on code. Fixed understanding of 'or' vs 'and' operators through practical examples. User has solid grasp of booleans now. Ready to move into conditional execution (if/elif/else statements) next session. The logical operators challenge exercise is queued up for next time as warm-up before diving into conditionals.

## Book Overview
Think Python consists of 21 chapters covering:
- **Chapters 1-4**: Basic programming concepts (variables, functions, case study)
- **Chapters 5-8**: Conditionals, fruitful functions, iteration, strings
- **Chapters 9-12**: Word play, lists, dictionaries, tuples
- **Chapters 13-16**: Case studies and data structures
- **Chapters 17-21**: Advanced topics (classes, inheritance, debugging, analysis)

# Think Python Progress Tracker
## Current Status
- **Current Chapter**: Chapter 5
- **Current Section**: Section 5.2
- **Last Completed**: Section 5.1 - Floor Division and Modulus (FULLY COMPLETED)
- **Next Target**: Boolean Expressions

## Short notes from the last session on what we did and where we are:
COMPLETED Section 5.1 entirely! User successfully:
- Answered all 3 "Test Your Understanding" questions 
- Implemented leap year checking with modulus
- Solved grouping problems using floor division and modulus
- Built wrap-around game logic from scratch, line by line
- Demonstrated deep understanding of modulus creating cyclic behavior
- Updated NOTES.md with excellent explanations of wrap-around effects

User's explanation of wrap-around was spot-on: "modulus gives the remainder after division which is exactly how much after full cycle has been forward we should go forward." Ready to start Section 5.2: Boolean Expressions.

NEXT SESSION: Start Section 5.2 covering True/False values, comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=), and the bool type. All Section 5.1 review questions are now complete.

# Think Python Progress Tracker
## Current Status
- **Current Chapter**: Chapter 5
- **Current Section**: Section 5.2
- **Last Completed**: Section 5.1 - Floor Division and Modulus
- **Next Target**: Boolean Expressions

## Short notes from the last session on what we did and where we are:
Completed Section 5.1 on Floor Division and Modulus operators. User successfully implemented practical examples including even/odd detection, divisibility testing, digit extraction, and cycling through days. Code is working well and pushed to repo. User has good understanding of // and % operators. 

PENDING: User still needs to answer these "Test Your Understanding" questions from Section 5.1 before moving to Section 5.2:
1. How would you check if a year is divisible by 4 (leap year check)?
2. If you have 37 items and want to put them in groups of 5, how many complete groups do you get and how many items are left over?
3. How could you use modulus to create a "wrap-around" effect in a game?

Next session should start with answering these questions, then move to Section 5.2: Boolean Expressions (True/False values, comparison operators ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, and the bool type). User understands the modulus concepts well but found the cycling through days and digit extraction examples needed a fresh look to fully click.

- **Current Section**: Section 5.1
- **Last Completed**: Ready to begin Chapter 5
- **Next Target**: Floor Division and Modulus operators

## Short notes from the last session on what we did and where we are:
Starting Chapter 5: Conditionals and Recursion. User has completed chapters 1-4 and is ready to learn about conditional execution, boolean expressions, and recursive functions. We'll focus on hands-on coding and practical understanding of each concept.
